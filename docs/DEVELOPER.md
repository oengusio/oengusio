# Oengus developer environment

This instruction provides steps on how to set up a development environment to work on Oengus backend.
See [DOCKER.md](./DOCKER.md) for Docker instructions.

## Prerequisites

Install packages which are needed for running Oengus. JDK 16 or later is required. Just install the latest JDK available
in your distribution. For example, for Java 17 on a Debian-based distro:

```shell
$ sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk postgresql
```

For other ways to install JDK and Postgres, see their respective websites:

- JDK, e.g. [Oracle JDK](https://www.java.com/en/download/) or [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/).
- https://www.postgresql.org/download/

## Source code

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:oengusio/oengusio.git
$ cd oengusio
```

## Postgres

If you haven't used Postgres before, set up a password for the connection to the database:

```shell
$ sudo su - postgres
postgres@hostname:~$ psql
postgres=# ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD '<your password here>';
```

Create database named `oengus` in your Postgres installation. For example, using the [`createdb` executable][createdb]:

```shell
postgres@hostname:~$ createdb oengus
```

## Discord integration

Discord integration is needed to allow you to login into your Oengus dev environment with your real Discord account.
You can also use Twitch integration, but Discord is recommended as the easiest to set up.

Follow [these instructions][Discord instructions] to create a Discord client ID and client secret values. Name your
application something like `<your name>-oengus-dev`.

## IntelliJ IDEA run config

The easiest way for developers to run Oengus is from an [IntelliJ IDEA run configuration][IntelliJ run configs].

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA by selecting Oengus's file `build.gradle` in the "Open..." dialog.
2. Open the "Run/Debug Configurations" dialog.
3. Make a copy of the config `OengusApplicationTemplate` for yourself by clicking the "Copy Configuration" button above
   the list.
4. Rename the new config.
5. Edit the environment variables to insert your own values for:

   ```
   DISCORD_CLIENT_ID
   DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET
   DB_PASSWORD
   ```
6. Run the configuration that you've created. The Oengus backend should now be running in your IDE!
